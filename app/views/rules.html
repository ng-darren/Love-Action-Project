	<h3>Our Rules</h3>
	<p>Love Action Project seeks to provide a platform for</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>individuals to embark on social/charity work,</li>
  	<li>individuals to showcase their talent and leadership,</li>
  	<li>individuals to socialize and network with other like-minded individuals, because we believe people with a good heart deserves to know another.</li>

				<h3>Projects are a one time event that has a altruism aim.</h3>
				<p>A project is a finite event with a clear charitable goal that you would like to bring to life. Think carnivals, celebrations, or concerts for orphanages and elders home. Or if you have some brilliantly creative ideas, and you are not sure if we will support it, <a href="#/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

					<h3>Projects must be honest and clearly presented.</h3>
				<p>Our community is built on trust and communication. Projects cannot mislead people or misrepresent facts, and creators should be candid about what they plan to accomplish. When a project involves something complex, we require project creators to show the commitment and know-how to realise that project.</p>
