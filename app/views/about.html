	<h3>What is Love Action Project?</h3>

	<p>Love Action Project vision is threefold.</p>

	<p>We seek to provide a platform for
		<ol>
			<li>individuals to embark on social/charity work,</li>
			<li>individuals to showcase their talent and leadership,</li>
			<li>individuals to socialize and network with other like-minded individuals, because we believe people with a good heart deserves to know another.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>We advocate the concept of “having fun but never forget to give”. As much as we provide an avenue for individuals to give, we also encourage them to step forward to showcase their talents, and develop their leadership skills with us. In addition, we also create a platform for everyone to socialize and network at the end of the day. Our concept of charity is not just one that provides an avenue to give, but rather, we wish to plant the seeds of charity in our volunteers’ hearts, so that they can reap the benefits of giving, and pay it forward to the society.</p>

	<p>In time to come, Love Action Project will look to pursue a much more interesting venture: Charity Overseas. Where we seek to create a unique overseas experience for Volunteers as we travel to countries around our region to for charity work. We wish to not only give volunteers time to give, but also time to interact with each other, meet new faces and make new friends and allow like-minded people to hang out and share the ideas.</p>

	<h3>Our Beliefs</h3>

	<p>Here in Love Action Project, we believe in the equal and inherent value of all human and animal life. We believe that a worldview bound by borders is outdated and that helping people and animals anywhere is the responsibility of humanity everywhere.</p>

	<h3>How does Love Action Project work?</h3>

	<p>Our team is constantly on the lookout for meaningful projects that fits the vision of our movement. Each project is independently created and crafted by the Love Action Project Team together with the supporting agencies/charity organisations. Our unique value proposition is that, even as we collaborate, we seek to have complete control and responsibility over the projects. This is to allow us to give opportunities for our volunteers to come in and influence the running of the projects, to enhance their involvement and experience of giving. Our volunteers will spend time to provide inputs or even be involved in our planning process weeks before an event, and see through the successful completion of it, knowing that they have been a major contributor to the success of it.</p>

	<p>Every project by Love Action Project requires sponsors. At such, we welcome organisations that wish to embark on charity work to join us.</p>
